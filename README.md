# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

It is a simple HTML and CSS solution to showcase a product preview card with a clean and modern design. 


## The challenge
The challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

1. My task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. There are both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

2. The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that I'll need to use my best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

3. There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information, such as color palette and fonts.


## Features
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
